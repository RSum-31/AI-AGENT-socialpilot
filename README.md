🚀 **AI Social Media Agent**

Automated, Brand-Aware Content Creation for LinkedIn & Instagram

📌 **Overview**

AI Social Media Agent is an intelligent content generation system that helps companies automatically create on-brand, high-quality social media posts for LinkedIn and Instagram.

It analyzes existing brand assets, understands brand voice and design patterns, and generates multiple post variations with captions and visuals. The system uses agentic self-feedback loops and keeps humans in the loop for editing and refinement.

This project was built as part of a hackathon challenge focused on real-world, scalable AI marketing automation.

🎯 **Problem Statement**

Creating consistent, high-quality social media content is:

Our AI Social Media Agent acts like a junior social media manager + designer by:

✅ Understanding brand tone and visual identity
